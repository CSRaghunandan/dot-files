All the dot-files for my Arch Linux installation with *i3-gaps* as the tiling
window manager.

** configuring the system

+ Configure *ZSH*:
  + Install and use ~zsh~ as the default shell by running ~chsh -s $(which zsh)~.
  + Install ~zimfw~ by following the instructions as defined [[https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw][here]]
  + After installation, run ~zimfw install~ followed by ~zimfw uninstall~, to
    modify the plugins for ~zimfw~.
  + Install ~alacritty~ as the default terminal.

+ Configure =ntp=:
  - Install =ntp= package and enable the ntp service
  - Run the following commands to disable =systemd-timesyncd=
    #+begin_src bash
    systemctl stop systemd-timesyncd
    systemctl disable systemd-timesyncd
    sudo timedatectl set-ntp False
    #+end_src

  - =sudo systemctl enable ntpd.service= -> to start ntpd at boot
  - enable logs and statistics for ntp
  - =ntpq -pn= -> show the status of ntp  
  
+ Keyboard configuration and mouse:
  + Install ~xorg-xmodmap~ for keyboard configuration: Left control is now
    =hyper= and Caps Lock is now =control=
  + Enable sticky keys are enabled without locking using =xkbset=
  + Add hook to suspend so that =xmodmap= is run and =sticky keys= are enabled
    after computer is resumed. This is necessary because X keyboard settings are
    reset after suspend.

    Create a file =/etc/systemd/system/resume@csraghunandan.service=
    #+BEGIN_SRC conf
[Unit]
Description=User resume actions
After=suspend.target

[Service]
User=csraghunandan
Type=simple
Environment=DISPLAY=:0
ExecStart=/usr/bin/bash /home/csraghunandan/.scripts/system/keeb

[Install]
WantedBy=suspend.target
    #+END_SRC
And run =sudo systemctl enable resume@.service=
    
  + reverse mouse scroll direction in i3

     By modifying libinput drivers for mouse/pointer in the file
     =/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-libinput.conf=

     #+BEGIN_SRC conf
Section "InputClass"
Identifier "libinput pointer catchall"
MatchIsPointer "on"
MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
Option "NaturalScrolling" "on"
Driver "libinput"
EndSection
     #+END_SRC
     
  + Add right click option to touchpad for double tap fingers and natural
     scrolling by adding to the same file above, the line:
     #+BEGIN_SRC conf
Option "Tapping" "on"                # enables tapping
Option "ClickMethod" "clickfinger"   # replaces synaptics tapping setup
Option "NaturalScrolling" "on"
#+END_SRC

+ Power management:
  + modify the following lines in ~/etc/systemd/logind.conf~:
    
    #+BEGIN_SRC conf
HandlePowerKey=suspend
HandleLidSwitch=suspend

IdleActionSec=30min  
#+END_SRC

    This will enable the system to:
    + =suspend= when pressed the power button instead of shutdown
    + If the system is idle for 30minutes, =suspend=

      exceeds a threshold
  + copy =low-battery-alert.service= and =low-battery-alert.timer= to
