    modify the plugins for ~zimfw~.

    #+begin_src bash
    systemctl stop systemd-timesyncd
    systemctl disable systemd-timesyncd
    sudo timedatectl set-ntp False
    #+end_src

* Keyboard configuration and mouse:
  + Install ~xorg-xmodmap~ for keyboard configuration: Left control is now
    =hyper= and Caps Lock is now =control=
  + Enable sticky keys are enabled without locking using =xkbset=
  + Add hook to suspend so that =xmodmap= is run and =sticky keys= are enabled
    after computer is resumed. This is necessary because X keyboard settings are
    reset after suspend.

    Create a file =/etc/systemd/system/resume@csraghunandan.service=
    #+BEGIN_SRC conf
[Unit]
Description=User resume actions
After=suspend.target

[Service]
User=csraghunandan
Type=simple
Environment=DISPLAY=:0
ExecStart=/usr/bin/bash /home/csraghunandan/.scripts/system/keeb

[Install]
WantedBy=suspend.target
    #+END_SRC
    And run =sudo systemctl enable resume@.service=
    
 + reverse mouse scroll direction in i3

     By modifying libinput drivers for mouse/pointer in the file
     =/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-libinput.conf=

     #+BEGIN_SRC conf
Section "InputClass"
Identifier "libinput pointer catchall"
MatchIsPointer "on"
MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
Option "NaturalScrolling" "on"

EndSection
     #+END_SRC
     
  + Add right click option to touchpad for double tap fingers and natural
     scrolling by adding to the same file above, the line:
